											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I'm Cole McCaleb, a dedicated computer science student at the University of Delaware. My ultimate goal is to graduate and secure a role in the AI and Software Engineering industry.

											While at the University of Delaware I am the captain of the Junior Varsity Valorant team. Over the course of the time with the team I have played in CVAL and ECAC where in ECAC we made playoffs. 
											
											When I'm not immersed in code or leading my team to victory, you'll find me indulging in my passions for go-karting, gaming, swimming and body building. These hobbies fuel my need for good body health and competition, providing the perfect balance to my tech-focused life.</p>

									<h3>Software Development Internship</h3>
									<p>-Employed the Atlassian Suite via Jira, Bitbucket, and Confluence to track the Agile Development Process which incorporated sprint planning, sprint review, daily standup, code reviews and merge requests. <br>
										-Assisted in testing a new idea to utilize Flutter as a way to create mobile apps for both Android and iOS simultaneously by translating some of our web applications such as a maintenance tool and a Sensor Monitoring tool to a mobile version. <br>
										-Worked With REST API backend in tandem with a Flutter application to view Sensor Maintenance information, post Sensor data to the server, and view the location of the sensors on a map by using the google maps API.
										-Converted ActiveMq information to a STOMP web socket that was used in a Flutter app for a proof of concept that showed that it was possible and could be later used as a template for future projects. <br>
										-Created a Flutter application that retrieved and posted authentication information to Firebase as a means to secure our applications with a program that is certified under major privacy and security standards.</p>

									<h3>Flutter App</h3>
									<p>I was part of a collaborative effort that seamlessly combined a REST API backend with a 
										Flutter application. This integration empowered users to efficiently access detailed Sensor 
										Maintenance information, submit Sensor data to the server, and gain a visual perspective of sensor 
										locations through the use of the Google Maps API. This holistic solution catered to the tracking and 
										management of sensors, enabling data retrieval, data contribution, and real-time location visualization 
										with ease and precision.

									<h3>shopping Website</h3>
									<p>I teamed up with five other individuals, and together, we employed an agile development 
										approach to create this user-friendly online shopping website. The agile methodology allowed us to 
										continuously adapt and refine the platform, This website was a user-friendly online shopping destination, 
										designed with drag-and-drop features for adding food items to a customer's cart. For managers, signing in 
										allowed them to easily edit and customize their own carts, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopping 
										experience for all.</p>

									<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
									<p>
										I designed and developed my own portfolio website to exhibit my work and accomplishments. 
										The exciting part is that I've made it publicly accessible on GitHub Pages. This means that anyone, 
										anywhere, can now explore my professional journey and the projects I've undertaken. It's a user-friendly 
										and visually engaging way to share my skills and experiences with the world, allowing me to connect 
										with a broader audience. </p>
